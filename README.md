# Typing Speed Test App
 
A simple app using the tkinter interface to test the speed of your typing. 
 
## Getting Started
 
Please clone the repository and run the `main.py` from the terminal to begin.
 
The sample text is represented by the pink text box and is 50 words selected at random from a list of 1000 most commonly used words in the English language. 

Select `start` to begin a 60-second countdown and begin typing the words on the screen in the green box below. 

After 60 seconds, you will be prompted with the average words per minute, and you can then press `clear` to delete the console and update the sample to start again. 
 
### Pending Improvements
 
I hope to look at record keeping and alerts based on different outcomes. 
 
### Thoughts
 
Whilst working on this project, I overthought a lot of the interaction without breaking it down into a very clean structure with minimal input. It has also made me think more about the GUI interface and how to use it in the future.
